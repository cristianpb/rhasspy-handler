# Snips handler

## Overview

I'm tired to search for my phone to put/change/stop music. Instead I use snips 
technology to control my music using voice (radio, podcast, streaming).

## Motivation

I want to control music coming from my raspberry pi, having some major concerns:

1. Have a Snips assistant for voice recognition. I actually I'm using an Spanish assistant, but Snips versatility allows to have also other kinds of languages.
2. Use a Bluetooth speaker. Sometimes I like to hear for loud music but since the microphone I use is near the speaker I prefer to use a Bluetooth speaker to avoid interference.
* Able to control all kind of music. I follow podcast but I also like to hear radio stations and stream music from online services like Soundcloud.
* Using `js` language for easy asynchronous executing. Instead of using python and specially python2 to control snips 

## Usage

Launching the following command will install dependencies automatically

```
make up
```

## Requirements

`nodejs npm`
